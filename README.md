# 📡 Temporal Frequency Hopping for Wireless Stealth Communication

A secure wireless communication system that uses **Temporal Frequency Hopping (TFH)** and **Dynamic Channel Hopping (DCH)** to prevent jamming and eavesdropping. The project integrates a **MATLAB GUI** with a **Flask-based web dashboard**, enabling real-time encrypted message/audio transmission, visualization, and performance analysis.
